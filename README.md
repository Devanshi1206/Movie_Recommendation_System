# Movie Recommendation System

## Executive Summary: 

The project aimed to assist users in discovering movies they would likely enjoy, enhancing the overall movie-watching experience. To accomplish this, I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Business Problem:

To identify movies for future viewing that are curated based on a film we have previously watched.

## Methodology:

Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict the personalised movie recommendation.

#### Steps:
1. Importing Data - Utilizing NumPy and Pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Cleaning the data, removing duplicates, creating a dataframe with only useful data, and generating new columns.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Stemming and text vectorization.
4. Machine Learning Modeling - Calculating cosine similarity.
5. Testing - Creating a function for recommendations.

## Skills:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Natural Language Programming
    Text Vectorization

## Result and Business Recommendation:

Successfully developed and implemented a recommendation model that identifies and suggests five movies tailored to the preferences of a specific film. This model utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze various attributes such as genre, director, and viewer ratings, ensuring relevant and personalized recommendations for users.

## Next Steps:

1. Making a Webpage to implement this model.
2. Msking same modle using Azure.
